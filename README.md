# ***Flexcom***

Flexcom is a command language written in GML (GameMaker Studio 2.3).
It can be used for debugging purposes or for any game that requires a console, for example a game about programming.
Flexcom also comes with a built-in IDE with full customisable colors and functions.

# **Installation**

Installing Flexcom is very straight forward.
Download the project, open it inside GMS and then go to:

`Tools -> Create Local Package -> Name it however you want`

Once you've created the package you can go into your own project and import it by:

`Tools -> Import Local Package -> Package name`

After this you've succesfully installed and imported Flexcom!

# **How to use**

For using Flexcom and it's console you can just select the `oConsole` and the `oInterpreter` file and put it inside your desired room.

## **Starting code**

Your Flexcom code must always start with the `run` function, followed by how many times you want to run your code.
